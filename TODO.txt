TODO list


In chunks:
First, worry about making the sign templates dynamic, either as just a block of page code or as assembled from a list of Regions. That can be done isolated and leave duration assignments hardcoded.
Then, once that's taken care of, worry about content types and assigning durations to different regions
Oh and at some point, probably best sooner than later, switch all these includes to be classes.


== SERVER ==

+Accept action=update queries to modify existing reservations
LT+PPT to PNG converter?

$id = filter_input(INPUT_GET, 'id', FILTER_SANITIZE_NUMBER_INT); // <-- filter your data first (see [Data Filtering](#data_filtering)), especially important for INSERT, UPDATE, etc.


New model for modular templates, durations on different regions
+ Players are associated with a Template
+ Template table
	Stores player structure and CSS from a Template table
	Nonnormalised "subtable" to keep track of regions?
	Figure out a way to make Regions nice and modular and easy to create
+ Durations are associated with Regions, preferably by integer id? blugh, this could get cumbersome.

Content overhaul
	Content now gets a Type
	Image - easy
	Weather - clunky but works
	Tabular data - External curl'd down data, needs src, headers, and keys

	
== PLAYER ==
	- If only one slide is present, don't keep transitioning it
	
== MANAGEMENT CONSOLE ==
+Modal scheduling widget
+Modify existing durations
Full UI redesign from the ground up
Theme out the JQueryUI
+Admin panel
Upload error output / Upload over AJAX
Apply class to appointments in the past or future for styling
more info on content (and durations)
Reset notice position on open
	
	
==DONE==
+Advanced PRIVS table
Ownership of content
	- Need privileges to delete other people's content
	- "Show all content" "Show just my content" toggle
Ownership of durations
	- Need privileges to edit other people's durations

+Unauthenticated unified JSON query that returns astra schedule and slides at once

Rewrite player to parse json into a slide array in advance, then pass that to the display-and-schedule function

PLAYER
	- Weather fetcher
	+Redesign overall look to feature secondary area for weather, crawl, etc.
	Dynamic regions
	- Change refresh pattern to use a single list of slides and only refresh at the end of the list AND after a refresh interval, to avoid a query storm when no data is available.
